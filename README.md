# HEALTHCARE-PROVIDER-FRAUD-DETECTION-ANALYSIS
New project on healthcare claims insurance fraud detection using python

I recently heard back from a recruiter on a healthcare claims fraud and anomaly detection data scientist. I used to do this work as a database analyst but I no longer have access to that data due to the protected health information (PHI). 
I found a healthcare insurance dataset on Kaggle so I want to create some analysis and develop fraud detection on this dataset.
